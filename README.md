# Frequent Itemeset Mining Algorithm Comparison
This project involved studying, implementing and comparing different algorithms for Frequent Itemset Mining, such as a baseline BruteFroce method, the Apriori algorithm, and its variants (PCY and MultiHash).
The algorithms were implemented in Python and compared in terms of final results, execution time, and memory usage.

The project was developed as part of the _Data Mining_ course at the University of Florence.
